# barnnamn

The barnnamn package is a Swedish equivalent to the babynames package. Anything you do with babynames you should be able to do with barnnamn instead. Loading the barnnamn library provides a single tibble, also called barnnamn, which shares the same structure as the babynames tibble from babynames.

The Swedish names data comes from the Statistiska centralbyr√•n (Central Statistical Bureau), which provides data from 1998 to 2020.
